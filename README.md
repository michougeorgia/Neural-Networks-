This repository contains three different projects focused on Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
Each project includes a separate report (detailed code description). The first project involves
the creation of a multilayer, fully connected perceptron trained using the backpropagation algorithm.
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training the network. The project has been implemented in Python, 
within the Google Colab environment, and the .ipynb file is attached.

The second project involves the creation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for the classification 
of two classes. The CIFAR-10 dataset is used, from which two different pairs of classes are selected. 
The project has been implemented in Python, within the Google Colab environment, and two .ipynb files 
are attachedâ€”one for an implementation from scratch (my_svm) and one using the pre-built SVM from the sklearn library (sklearnSVM).

The third project involves the implementation of a convolutional autoencoder using Keras and TensorFlow, 
with the purpose of reconstructing samples, specifically the images contained in the CIFAR-10 dataset 
(the same dataset used in the previous two projects). The code was developed on Kaggle.
